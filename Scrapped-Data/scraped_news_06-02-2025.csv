There was a significant delay in the recognition of material adverse impairment of assets,"" Sebi's whole time member Ananth Narayan G said in the final order.Further, Sebi observed that accounting irregularities led to artificial inflation of headline profits to the extent of Rs 1,280.06 crore during FY19 and FY20.Accordingly, Sebi directed BGL to disseminate the standalone financial statements of each of its subsidiaries on its website, for the period between 2014-15 and 2021-22, as required under disclosure norms within 15 days from the date of this order.The regulator noted that the noticees -- M Suresh Kumar Reddy, Vijay Kancharla, Yerradoddi Ramesh Reddy and Y Srinivasa Rao -- were executive directors, audit committee members and KMP during different periods.Therefore, they were, at the relevant points in time, responsible for the day-to-day affairs and management of BGL and were involved in the approval of the misrepresented financial statements, Sebi said.Sebi observed that the various violations related to accounting standards and disclosures, including incorrect shareholding pattern, which took place between 2014-15 and 2019-20, enabled the promoters of BGL to offload their shareholding from 40.45 per cent in March 2014 to 3.51 per cent in June 2022.Suresh Kumar Reddy and Vijay Kancharla were also part of the promoter group, which offloaded their shareholding during this period, the order said.By being a part of this fraudulent scheme of manipulation of financial statements and disclosure violations, Sebi found that BGL, Suresh Reddy, Kancharla, Ramesh Reddy and Srinivasa Rao have prima facie enabled the promoter group to make illegal gains.Accordingly, these entities have violated provisions of Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (PFUTP) norms as well, it added.Pursuant to receipt of complaints during October 2020 to March 2021, Sebi passed an interim order-cum-show cause notice on April 13, 2023 against BGL and its promoters/directors alleging misstatements and accounting irregularities in the company's financial statements for financial years (FYs) from 2014-15 to 2019-20.Further, it was alleged that accounting irregularities and other disclosure violations were part of a scheme to defraud investors which enabled promoters to offload their shares at elevated prices.(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)"

According to CareEdge Ratings, net profit margins across the industry are expected to contract by 400 basis points, while revenue growth is likely to decelerate to 13%, a steep slowdown from the 29% compound annual growth rate recorded between FY22 and FY24.The regulatory clampdown, aimed at curbing excessive retail participation in derivatives, has led to sweeping changes, including higher Securities Transaction Tax (STT) rates, increased Market Infrastructure Institutions (MII) charges, and modifications in futures and options (F&O) trading rules. These measures have already triggered a sharp decline in F&O turnover, which fell from Rs 11,410 trillion in October 2024 to Rs 6,044 trillion by December 2024.The recent regulatory changes have directly impacted brokers’ revenue streams and profitability, CareEdge Ratings said in its latest report. “While F&O volumes have dropped, cash segment volumes have remained relatively stable, with some recovery observed in December 2024.” The ratings firm said it expects cash market volumes to stabilize at Rs 21-22 trillion per month in the near term.The impact of regulatory changes is evident in financial projections for stockbrokers. Industry-wide revenues, which stood at Rs 23,500 crore in the first half of FY25, are expected to dip to Rs 20,500 crore in the second half. While net profit margins are set to fall to 32% from 36% in FY24, absolute profits are expected to remain largely stable as brokers look for ways to mitigate the downturn, the ratings firm noted.Also read |Can Asian Paints shares tumble to Rs 2,000?

The MTF book has expanded at a 70% compound annual growth rate since FY22, reaching Rs 57,000 crore in FY24 and further rising to Rs 81,300 crore by January 2025. CareEdge Ratings said it expects the MTF book to touch Rs 90,000 crore by the end of FY25.“MTF has emerged as an attractive diversification tool for stockbrokers amidst a fall in futures and options (F&O) volumes,” CareEdge Ratings said. The share of MTF interest income in total broker revenues has climbed from 8.1% in FY22 to 10.4% in September 2024 and is expected to reach 12% in the second half of FY25.While the stockbrokers’ shift to MTF for revenue growth is helping to cushion some of the impact of regulatory changes, it has also led to increased leverage levels in the industry. However, CareEdge Ratings said it believes gearing ratios remain manageable given the inherently low capital intensity of traditional broking businesses.With regulatory pressures reshaping market dynamics, the ability of stockbrokers to adapt and diversify revenue streams will be crucial in navigating the evolving landscape.Also read |PVR Inox Q3 Results: Net profit jumps 180% YoY to Rs 36 crore, revenue grows 11%(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The BoE warned that it likely contracted by 0.1% in the fourth quarter.Stock TradingMaximise Returns by Investing in the Right CompaniesBy - The Economic Times, Get Certified By India's Top Business News BrandView ProgramStock TradingMarket 104: Options Trading: Kickstart Your F&O AdventureBy - Saketh R, Founder- QuickAlpha, Full Time Options TraderView ProgramStock TradingTechnical Analysis for Everyone - Technical Analysis CourseBy - Abhijit Paul, Technical Research Head, Fund Manager- ICICI SecuritiesView ProgramStock TradingStock Markets Made EasyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView ProgramStock TradingRenko Chart Patterns Made EasyBy - Kaushik Akiwatkar, Derivative Trader and InvestorView ProgramStock TradingMarket 101: An Insight into Trendlines and MomentumBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarkets 102: Mastering Sentiment Indicators for Swing and Positional TradingBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingDow Theory Made EasyBy - Vishal Mehta, Independent Systematic TraderView ProgramStock TradingMarket 103: Mastering Trends with RMI and Techno-Funda InsightsBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingROC Made Easy: Master Course for ROC Stock IndicatorBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingHeikin Ashi Trading Tactics: Master the Art of TradingBy - Dinesh Nagpal, Full Time Trader, Ichimoku & Trading Psychology ExpertView ProgramStock TradingRSI Made Easy: RSI Trading CourseBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingIntroduction to Technical Analysis & Candlestick TheoryBy - Dinesh Nagpal, Full Time Trader, Ichimoku & Trading Psychology ExpertView ProgramThursday's rate cut is only the third since the BoE started lowering borrowing costs from a 14-year high in August and leaves British rates among the highest for advanced economies and just above the U.S. Federal Reserve's range of 4.25-4.5%.Last month, economists polled by Reuters had forecast the BoE would make four quarter-point rate cuts this year, lowering its main interest rate to 3.75%, while more recently markets saw cuts to 4% as more likely.Minutes of February's decision showed some policymakers wanted a ""cautious"" approach to future rate cuts because of weak productivity that could push up inflation, while others saw less of a risk of persistent above-target inflation but said the BoE still needed to be ""careful"".The outlook for Britain's economy is worse than when the BoE published its last full set of forecasts in November.Inflation - already above target at 2.5% - is expected to peak at around 3.7% in the third quarter of this year due to higher energy prices and expected increases in regulated water bills and bus fares, up from a previous forecast peak of 2.8%.The BoE does not expect inflation to fall back to its 2% target until the final quarter of 2027, six months later than it had forecast before.The central bank also halved its forecast for growth this year to 0.75% - reflecting weak business and consumer sentiment and more sluggish productivity growth - although forecasts for annual growth in 2026 and 2027 were revised fractionally higher to 1.5% from 1.25%.The BoE said it was unclear exactly how any future U.S. tariffs would affect inflation in Britain, but said higher global tariffs were likely to cause slower growth, even if Britain was not specifically targeted.These forecasts were based on market expectations for a slower pace of rate cuts than in November, with interest rates dropping to around 4.25% by the end of this year versus about 3.75% expected before.The two policymakers who voted for an immediate cut in rates to 4.25% had different reasoning. The minutes did not say which view was linked to Mann or Dhingra, although one of the policymakers was described as supporting an ""activist"" approach, the language previously used by Mann.For the ""activist"" policymaker, voting for a bigger rate cut would give a clearer signal to markets, although she expected monetary policy would still need to stay restrictive for some time.For the other policymaker, weak growth was likely to ensure that inflation would return to target in the medium term.(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)"
