However, it asked the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to decide “within shortest possible time” on Danny Gaekwad Developments & Investments' application for reconsideration of its competing offer to acquire additional stake in REL.The Division Bench said that the open offer process would be subject to the outcome of the appeal and Tuesday's order was passed “without prejudice to the rights of either of the parties in the case.”Meanwhile, another single judge bench of Justice PK Kaurav refused to stay a resolution related to reappointment of Religare executive director Rashmi Saluja as a director at the company’s upcoming AGM, thus clearing the way for the AGM and the voting on the appointment of a new director.Stock TradingMaximise Returns by Investing in the Right CompaniesBy - The Economic Times, Get Certified By India's Top Business News BrandView ProgramStock TradingMarket 104: Options Trading: Kickstart Your F&O AdventureBy - Saketh R, Founder- QuickAlpha, Full Time Options TraderView ProgramStock TradingTechnical Analysis for Everyone - Technical Analysis CourseBy - Abhijit Paul, Technical Research Head, Fund Manager- ICICI SecuritiesView ProgramStock TradingStock Markets Made EasyBy - elearnmarkets, Financial Education by StockEdgeView ProgramStock TradingRenko Chart Patterns Made EasyBy - Kaushik Akiwatkar, Derivative Trader and InvestorView ProgramStock TradingMarket 101: An Insight into Trendlines and MomentumBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingMarkets 102: Mastering Sentiment Indicators for Swing and Positional TradingBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingDow Theory Made EasyBy - Vishal Mehta, Independent Systematic TraderView ProgramStock TradingMarket 103: Mastering Trends with RMI and Techno-Funda InsightsBy - Rohit Srivastava, Founder- Indiacharts.comView ProgramStock TradingROC Made Easy: Master Course for ROC Stock IndicatorBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingHeikin Ashi Trading Tactics: Master the Art of TradingBy - Dinesh Nagpal, Full Time Trader, Ichimoku & Trading Psychology ExpertView ProgramStock TradingRSI Made Easy: RSI Trading CourseBy - Souradeep Dey, Equity and Commodity Trader, TrainerView ProgramStock TradingIntroduction to Technical Analysis & Candlestick TheoryBy - Dinesh Nagpal, Full Time Trader, Ichimoku & Trading Psychology ExpertView ProgramWhile Saluja, who is set to retire by rotation, told the HC that her appointment was for a fixed term of five years, ending on February 25, 2028, Justice Kaurav noted that she was appointed for a five-year term in 2023 and even the board meeting and the January 15 notice for the AGM expressly stipulatedretirementby rotation.“This clearly indicates that the understanding of the plaintiff (Saluja) that she is liable to retire is not something that was introduced for the first time in 2025... It is evident that the plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case in her favour,” Justice Kaurav stated in his order.A single judge bench of Justice Manoj Jain had on January 30 refused to halt the takeover by Burmans, who own Dabur, and also stay Religare’s AGM scheduled for February 7, as sought by Bangkok-based minority investor Sapna Govind Rao.Rao in her appeal sought a direction to SEBI and the ReserveBankof India to evaluate Danny Gaekwad Developments & Investments’ “significantly higher” offer of Rs 275 per share for Religare against the Burmans’ offer of Rs 235.Besides seeking quashing of the RBI’s conditional approval granted on December 9 to the Burman family foracquisitionof Religare, Rao, who owns 500sharesin the financial services firm, sought a stay on the acquisition until a fair valuation of the company was completed.Senior counsel CA Sundaram, appearing for Rao, alleged that the proposed takeover by Burmans undervalues the company's shares.U.S.-based entrepreneur and investor of Indian origin Danny Gaekwad through Danny Gaekwad Developments & Investments, also filed a separate intervention application in the matter. Senior counsel Rajiv Nayyar and counsel Saurabh Seth, appearing for Danny, told the court that SEBI had on January 30 failed to adequately consider its competing offer, which was returned based on procedural technicalities rather than being substantively examined under the SEBI regulatory framework.Asserting her right to continue as a director until 2028, Saluja through senior counsel Sandeep Sethi had sought a mandatory and permanent injunction for declaring the agenda and the proposed resolution for appointment of a director in the AGM as “null and void” and also a direction to Religare to withdraw the agenda item/proposed resolution.The AGM will be keenly watched by the market participation as it involves the reappointment of Saluja, who has been at the helm of a battle with the Burman family on the control of the company. Three leading proxy firms—Stakeholders Empowerment Services, Institutional Investor Advisory Services, and InGovern Research—have recommended an 'against' vote on the resolution pertaining to Saluja's reappointment, citing concerns over corporate governance, employee stock ownership plans and higher remuneration.In August, the Enforcement Directorate had searched the premises of Saluja in connection with a case of cheating and criminal conspiracy to defraud shareholders of Religare Enterprises.The Burman family, currently the largest shareholder in Religare with a stake of around 25%, announced the open offer in September 2023 to increase its stake and take control of the company. The Burman family is looking to oust Saluja even though she has the backing of the company.While senior counsel Neeraj Malhotra appeared for SEBI, Burmans were represented by senior counsel AM Singhvi, Mahesh Jethmalani, and others.(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)"
