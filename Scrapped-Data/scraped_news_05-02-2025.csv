Tesla and Musk are almost inextricably linked.""Musk also drew criticism in Germany over his gesture at an inauguration event for Trump that critics likened to a Nazi salute, an accusation that the Tesla boss has rejected.Afterwards, activists projected an image of the salute and the word ""Heil"" onto the outside of Tesla plant near Berlin.Last month total electric car sales in Germany rebounded by over 53 percent from a year earlier, with 34,498 sold, the KBA data showed.However sales in the same month in 2024 were very low as government subsidies had only recently been phased out, and overall the figure for January 2025 was still quite subdued.But the sector is expected to recover in 2025, with manufacturers forced to slash prices for EVs as they race to sell more to hit stricter EU carbon emissions targets.(You can now subscribe to ourETMarkets WhatsApp channel)"

05-02-2025,/markets/stocks/news/micro-msme-stress-now-behind-ujjivan-sfb-likely-to-rebound-in-fy26/articleshow/117953531.cms,"The stock ofUjjivan Small Finance Bankhas bounced back nearly 16% from the 52-week low level of around Rs 32 reached on January 28 following a disappointing third quarter performance. The stock has gained momentum after the bank announced the plan to apply for the universal banking license, which is expected to improve its reach and range of financial services. Given the lacklustre December quarter performance, analysts have cut earnings forecasts and reduced the price targets for the bank by 2-5%.Small Finance Bank (SFB) is a specific banking structure created by the RBI in 2014 to extend basic banking services such as deposit and credit facilities to the unserved and underserved as a part of financial inclusion. However, SFBs face certain restrictions and disadvantages such as inability to run nonbanking financial subsidiaries and higher cost of funds to compensate for higher deposit rates to attract customers. They also need to allocate 75% of the net advances to priority sectors — agriculture, micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME), education and housing —with 40% in the case of universal banks. RBI also mandates that SFBs need to have 50% of the loan portfolio consisting of low ticket loans upto Rs 25 lakh. These restrictions tend to put pressure on the asset quality and profitability of SFBs as they tend to have higher gross nonperforming assets (NPA) ratios.A universal banking license, therefore, will be a major step for an SFB while pursuing the next phase of growth. To avail it, RBI stipulates that an SFB should be listed and needs to have a minimum networth of Rs1,000 crore. Also, gross NPA and net NPA in the past two fiscal years need to be either 3% and 1% or lower, respectively.Ujjivan SFBfits the bill.The bank’s gross loan book increased by 9.8% year-on-year to Rs30,466 crore in the December quarter but the disbursements fell by 5.5% to Rs5,362 crore due to lower microfinance related disbursements. The gross NPA ratio deteriorated to 2.7% from 2.1% year-on-year on account of stress in the microfinance portfolio where the NPA increased to 3.6% from 1.8% a year ago. The asset quality for the newly disbursed loans has been better. For instance, the new MSME book at Rs 815 crore, which forms 48% of the segment’s outstanding loans, has nil NPA whereas housing and micro loan book has an NPA of 1.1%.The company has been focussing on improving the share of secured assets in the loan book. The secured loans grew by 52% year-on-year in the December quarter and formed 39.3% of the loan book compared with 28.3% in the year-ago period. Given these factors, analysts have retained the “buy’ call on the stock despite a weak third quarter. Axis Securities has reduced the target price to Rs39 from Rs41 earlier while retaining the valuation multiple of one relative to the expected book value for September 2026.
